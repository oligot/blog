There we are, my blog is finally up and running and it's time to write the first article! I've long wanted to start a blog but declined to do so until now: lack of time.

Before diving in, I would like to explain how I came here. The lack of time was not the only reason not to start blogging. I wanted to host the blog on a machine I could play with: install, configure, test, break, ...
Enter [Amazon EC2](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/): a cheap solution to have a box in the cloud. I decided to install Debian on it and followed the amazing articles at arstechnica entitled [Web Served](http://arstechnica.com/series/web-served/) and I have now a fresh instance of the [Ghost blogging platform](https://ghost.org/) in front of me !

So, what kind of articles will I write ? Tutorials, best practices, who knows ? Time will tell us...

Anyway, I hope you'll enjoy reading these articles as much as I enjoyed writing them.

See you soon...
