This is a really small post to celebrate that the [go-mod-upgrade](https://github.com/oligot/go-mod-upgrade) project has just reached 1000 stars on GitHub :tada:

![go-mod-upgrade](/go-mod-upgrade.jpg)

I started the project 5 years ago when learning Go.
At that time, I was writing a lot of Node.js code and I was used to the [yarn upgrade-interactive](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/upgrade-interactive/) command.
When switching to Go, I couldn't find a similar tool so I decided to write one, mainly to learn Go.
In the meantime, people started to contribute to the project and added awesome features like [workspace support](https://github.com/oligot/go-mod-upgrade/issues/25), the recent [Go 1.24 tools support](https://github.com/oligot/go-mod-upgrade/pull/60) or [a flag to update all modules in non-interactive mode](https://github.com/oligot/go-mod-upgrade/pull/11).

Thanks to all the contributors, and let's continue to improve the project together!
